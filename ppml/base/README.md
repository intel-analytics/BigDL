# Gramine PPML Base Image

This folder contains the Dockerfile needed to build the Gramine PPML Base Image.

## Build Image

To build the image, setup the proxy settings in the `build-docker-image.sh` if proxy is needed.  Otherwise, just run `./build-docker-image.sh` to build the image.


## For those who wants to extend this image:

### New working directory

The working directory is now set to `/ppml/` instead of `/ppml/trusted-big-data-ml/`.

For instance, the `bash.manifest.template` originally loads the library from `/ppml/trusted-big-data-ml/work/lib`.  Now, it will load the library from `/ppml/work/lib`

All the corresponding files including

1. bash.manifest.template
2. clean.sh
3. init.sh
4. Makefile

are changed accordingly.

### Mount files needed by bash.manifest.template

The following four directories required by the `bash.manifest.template` are no longer added to the image.
```bash
  { path = "/root/.kube/", uri = "file:/root/.kube/" },
  { path = "/root/.keras", uri = "file:/root/.keras" },
  { path = "/root/.m2", uri = "file:/root/.m2" },
  { path = "/root/.zinc", uri = "file:/root/.zinc" },
```


To ensure that the `bash.manifest.template` works correctly, add the following block into your image's Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
RUN  mkdir -p /root/.keras/datasets && \
     mkdir -p /root/.zinc && \
     mkdir -p /root/.m2 && \
     mkdir -p /root/.kube/
```

### Set ENV in your image

The image have Python3.7 installed.  If this is what you needed, put the following command into your image:
```dockerfile
ENV PYTHONPATH   /usr/lib/python3.7:/usr/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload:/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages:/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
```

Otherwise, install your version of Python and set the `PYTHONPATH` accordingly.

Besides, you may also want to set the `WORKDIR` and the `ENTRYPOINT` in your image.

## What is included in the image?

The image only contains these important components:

1. Python3.7 and some packages.
2. Gramine.
3. Three patches applied to the Python source code and its packages.
4. Package sgxsdk and dcap, required by remote attestation.
5. Script for register MREnclave and verify remote EHSM (The jars required are not fully provided).
