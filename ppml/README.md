## What is BigDL PPML
### States of data
In computing, data exists in three states: data in transit, data at rest, and data in use. 
1. Data being transferred on a network is “in transit”. tls
2. data in storage is “at rest”. transparent database encryption.
3. data being processed is “in use”. computing

### Confidential computing
[Confidential computing](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security/confidential-computing.html) is an emerging industry initiative focused on helping to secure data in use.

The efforts can enable encrypted data to be processed in memory while lowering the risk of exposing it to the rest of the system, thereby reducing the potential for sensitive data to be exposed while providing a higher degree of control and transparency for users. In multi-tenant cloud environments, where sensitive data is meant to be kept isolated from other privileged portions of the system stack, Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) plays a large role in making this capability a reality.

### BigDL PPML
[BigDL](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL) makes it easy for data scientists and data engineers to build end-to-end, distributed AI applications. [BigDL PPML](https://bigdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/PPML/Overview/ppml.html) provides a Trusted Cluster Environment for protecting the end-to-end Big Data AI pipeline. It combines various low level hardware and software security technologies (e.g., Intel SGX, LibOS such as Graphene and Occlum, Federated Learning, etc.), and allows users to run unmodified Big Data analysis and ML/DL programs (such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc.) in a secure fashion on (private or public) cloud.
