## 1. What is BigDL PPML?



https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61072813/184758908-da01f8ea-8f52-4300-9736-8c5ee981d4c0.mp4





Protecting data privacy and confidentiality is critical in a world where data is everywhere. In recent years, more and more countries have enacted data privacy legislation or are expected to pass comprehensive legislation to protect data privacy, the importance of privacy and data protection is increasingly recognized.

To better protect sensitive data, it's necessary to ensure security for all dimensions of data lifecycle: data at rest, data in transit, and data in use. Data being transferred on a network is `in transit`, data in storage is `at rest`, and data being processed is `in use`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61072813/177720405-60297d62-d186-4633-8b5f-ff4876cc96d6.png" alt="data lifecycle" width='390px' height='260px'/>
</p>

To protect data in transit, enterprises often choose to encrypt sensitive data prior to moving or use encrypted connections (HTTPS, SSL, TLS, FTPS, etc) to protect the contents of data in transit. For protecting data at rest, enterprises can simply encrypt sensitive files prior to storing them or choose to encrypt the storage drive itself. However, the third state, data in use has always been a weakly protected target. There are three emerging solutions that seek to reduce the data-in-use attack surface: homomorphic encryption, multi-party computation, and confidential computing. 

Among these security technologies, [Confidential computing](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security/confidential-computing.html) protects data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based [Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment). [Intel® SGX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html) is Intel's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), offering hardware-based memory encryption that isolates specific application code and data in memory. [Intel® TDX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-trust-domain-extensions.html) is the next generation of Intel's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), introducing new, architectural elements to help deploy hardware-isolated, virtual machines (VMs) called trust domains (TDs).

[PPML](https://bigdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/PPML/Overview/ppml.html) (Privacy Preserving Machine Learning) in [BigDL 2.0](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL) provides a Trusted Cluster Environment for secure Big Data & AI applications, even on untrusted cloud environment. By combining Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) with several other security technologies (e.g., attestation, key management service, private set intersection, federated learning, homomorphic encryption, etc.), BigDL PPML ensures end-to-end security enabled for the entire distributed workflows, such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, XGBoost, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.

## 2. Why BigDL PPML?
PPML allows organizations to explore powerful AI techniques while working to minimize the security risks associated with handling large amounts of sensitive data. PPML protects data at rest, in transit and in use: compute and memory protected by SGX Enclaves, storage (e.g., data and model) protected by encryption, network communication protected by remote attestation and Transport Layer Security (TLS), and optional Federated Learning support.

- **Trusted FL (Federated Learning)**: with PSI (Private Set Intersection), Secured Aggregation and trusted federated learning support, users can build a united model across different parties without compromising privacy, even if these parties have different datasets or features.

## 3. Getting Started with PPML

### 3.1 BigDL PPML Hello World
In this section, you can get started with running a simple native python HelloWorld program and a simple native Spark Pi program locally in a BigDL PPML local docker container to get an initial understanding of the usage of ppml. 

<details><summary>Click to see detailed steps</summary>

**a. Prepare Images**

For demo purposes, we will skip building the custom image here and use the public reference image provided by BigDL PPML `intelanalytics/bigdl-ppml-trusted-bigdata-gramine-reference-8g:2.3.0-SNAPSHOT` to have a quick start.

Note: This public image is only for demo purposes, it is non-production. For security concerns, you are strongly recommended to generate your enclave key and build your custom image for your production environment. Refer to [How to Prepare Your PPML image for production environment](#step-1-prepare-your-ppml-image-for-production-environment).

**b. Prepare Keys**

* generate ssl_key

  Download scripts from [here](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL).

  ```
  cd BigDL/ppml/
  sudo bash scripts/generate-keys.sh
  ```
  This script will generate keys under keys/ folder

**c. Start the BigDL PPML Local Container**
```
# KEYS_PATH means the absolute path to the keys folder in step a
# LOCAL_IP means your local IP address.
export KEYS_PATH=YOUR_LOCAL_KEYS_PATH
export LOCAL_IP=YOUR_LOCAL_IP
# ppml graphene image is deprecated, please use the gramine version
export DOCKER_IMAGE=intelanalytics/bigdl-ppml-trusted-big-data-ml-python-gramine-reference:2.3.0-SNAPSHOT

sudo docker pull $DOCKER_IMAGE

### 3.2 BigDL PPML End-to-End Workflow
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61072813/178393982-929548b9-1c4e-4809-a628-10fafad69628.png)
In this section, we take SimpleQuery as an example to go through the entire BigDL PPML end-to-end workflow. SimpleQuery is a simple example to query developers between the ages of 20 and 40 from people.csv.




https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61072813/184758702-4b9809f9-50ac-425e-8def-0ea1c5bf1805.mp4



#### Step 0. Preparation your environment
To secure your Big Data & AI applications in BigDL PPML manner, you should prepare your environment first, including K8s cluster setup, K8s-SGX plugin setup, key/password preparation, key management service (KMS) and attestation service (AS) setup, BigDL PPML client container preparation. **Please follow the detailed steps in** [Prepare Environment](./docs/prepare_environment.md). 

Next, you are going to build a base image, and a custom image on top of it to avoid leaving secrets e.g. enclave key in images/containers. After that, you need to register the mrenclave in your custom image to Attestation Service Before running your application, and PPML will verify the runtime MREnclave automatically at the backend. The below chart illustrated the whole workflow:
![PPML Workflow with MREnclave](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60865256/197942436-7e40d40a-3759-49b4-aab1-826f09760ab1.png)

Start your application with the following guide step by step:

#### Step 1. Prepare your PPML image for the production environment
To build a secure PPML image that can be used in a production environment, BigDL prepared a public base image that does not contain any secrets. You can customize your image on top of this base image.

1. Prepare BigDL Base Image

    The bigdata base image is a public one that does not contain any secrets. You will use the base image to get your own custom image in the following.

    You can use our public bigdata base image `intelanalytics/bigdl-ppml-trusted-bigdata-gramine-base:2.3.0-SNAPSHOT`, which is recommended. Or you can build your own base image, which is expected to be exactly the same as ours.

    Before building your own base image, please modify the paths in `ppml/trusted-bigdata/build-base-image.sh`. Then build the docker image with the following command.

    ```bash
    ./build-bigdata-base-image.sh
    ```

2. Build Custom Image

    When the base image is ready, you need to generate your enclave key which will be used when building a custom image and keep the enclave key safe for future remote attestations.

    Running the following command to generate the enclave key `enclave-key.pem` , which is used to launch and sign SGX Enclave. 

    ```bash
    cd custom-image
    openssl genrsa -3 -out enclave-key.pem 3072
    ```

    When the enclave key `enclave-key.pem` is generated, you are ready to build your custom image by running the following command: 

    ```bash
    # under bigdl-gramine dir
    # modify custom parameters in build-custom-image.sh
    ./build-custom-image.sh
    cd ..
    ```
    **Warning:** If you want to skip DCAP attestation in runtime containers, you can set `ENABLE_DCAP_ATTESTATION` to *false* in `build-custom-image.sh`, and this will generate a none-attestation image. **But never do this unsafe operation in production!**

    The sensitive enclave key will not be saved in the built image. Two values `mr_enclave` and `mr_signer` are recorded while the Enclave is built, you can find `mr_enclave` and `mr_signer` values in the console log, which are hash values used to register your MREnclave in the following attestation step.

    ````bash
    [INFO] Use the below hash values of mr_enclave and mr_signer to register enclave:
    mr_enclave       : c7a8a42af......
    mr_signer        : 6f0627955......
    ````

    Note: you can also customize the image according to your own needs, e.g. install an extra python library, add code, or jars.

    Then, start a client container:

    ```
    export K8S_MASTER=k8s://$(sudo kubectl cluster-info | grep 'https.*6443' -o -m 1)
    echo The k8s master is $K8S_MASTER .
    export DATA_PATH=/YOUR_DIR/data
    export KEYS_PATH=/YOUR_DIR/keys
    export SECURE_PASSWORD_PATH=/YOUR_DIR/password
    export KUBECONFIG_PATH=/YOUR_DIR/config
    export LOCAL_IP=$LOCAL_IP
    export DOCKER_IMAGE=intelanalytics/bigdl-ppml-trusted-bigdata-gramine-reference-8g:2.3.0-SNAPSHOT # or the custom image built by yourself

    sudo docker run -itd \
        --privileged \
        --net=host \
        --name=bigdl-ppml-client-k8s \
        --cpus=10 \
        --oom-kill-disable \
        --device=/dev/sgx/enclave \
        --device=/dev/sgx/provision \
        -v /var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket:/var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket \
        -v $DATA_PATH:/ppml/data \
        -v $KEYS_PATH:/ppml/keys \
        -v $SECURE_PASSWORD_PATH:/ppml/password \
        -v $KUBECONFIG_PATH:/root/.kube/config \
        -e RUNTIME_SPARK_MASTER=$K8S_MASTER \
        -e RUNTIME_DRIVER_HOST=$LOCAL_IP \
        -e RUNTIME_K8S_SPARK_IMAGE=$DOCKER_IMAGE \
        -e RUNTIME_DRIVER_PORT=54321 \
        -e RUNTIME_DRIVER_MEMORY=1g \
        -e LOCAL_IP=$LOCAL_IP \
        $DOCKER_IMAGE bash
    ```

#### Step 2. Attestation

Enter the client container:
```
sudo docker exec -it bigdl-ppml-client-k8s bash
```

If you do not need the attestation, you can disable the attestation service. You should configure `spark-driver-template.yaml` and `spark-executor-template` in the client container.yaml to set `ATTESTATION` value to `false` and skip the rest of the step. By default, the attestation service is disabled.
``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  ...
    env:
      - name: ATTESTATION
        value: false
  ...
```

The bi-attestation guarantees that the MREnclave in runtime containers is a secure one made by you. Its workflow is as below:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60865256/198168194-d62322f8-60a3-43d3-84b3-a76b57a58470.png)


To enable attestation, you should have a running Attestation Service in your environment.

**1. Deploy EHSM KMS & AS**

  KMS (Key Management Service) and AS (Attestation Service) make sure applications of the customer run in the SGX MREnclave signed above by customer-self, rather than a fake one fake by an attacker.

  BigDL PPML uses EHSM as a reference KMS & AS, you can follow the guide [here](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/tree/main/ppml/services/ehsm/kubernetes#deploy-bigdl-ehsm-kms-on-kubernetes-with-helm-charts) to deploy EHSM in your environment.

**2. Enroll in EHSM**

Execute the following command to enroll yourself in EHSM, The `<kms_ip>` is your configured-ip of EHSM service in the deployment section:

```bash
curl -v -k -G "https://<kms_ip>:9000/ehsm?Action=Enroll"
......
{"code":200,"message":"successful","result":{"apikey":"E8QKpBB******","appid":"8d5dd3b*******"}}
```

You will get an `appid` and `apikey` pair. Please save it for later use.

**3. Attest EHSM Server (optional)**

You can attest EHSM server and verify the service is trusted before running workloads to avoid sending your secrets to a fake service.

To attest EHSM server, start a BigDL container using the custom image built before. **Note**: this is the other container different from the client.

```bash
export KEYS_PATH=YOUR_LOCAL_SPARK_SSL_KEYS_FOLDER_PATH
export LOCAL_IP=YOUR_LOCAL_IP
export CUSTOM_IMAGE=YOUR_CUSTOM_IMAGE_BUILT_BEFORE
export PCCS_URL=YOUR_PCCS_URL # format like https://1.2.3.4:xxxx, obtained from KMS services or a self-deployed one

sudo docker run -itd \
    --privileged \
    --net=host \
    --cpus=5 \
    --oom-kill-disable \
    -v /var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket:/var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket \
    -v $KEYS_PATH:/ppml/trusted-big-data-ml/work/keys \
    --name=gramine-verify-worker \
    -e LOCAL_IP=$LOCAL_IP \
    -e PCCS_URL=$PCCS_URL \
    $CUSTOM_IMAGE bash
```

Enter the docker container:

```bash
sudo docker exec -it gramine-verify-worker bash
```

Set the variables in `verify-attestation-service.sh` before running it:

  ```
  `ATTESTATION_URL`: URL of attestation service. Should match the format `<ip_address>:<port>`.

  `APP_ID`, `API_KEY`: The appID and apiKey pair generated by your attestation service.

  `ATTESTATION_TYPE`: Type of attestation service. Currently support `EHSMAttestationService`.

  `CHALLENGE`: Challenge to get a quote for attestation service which will be verified by local SGX SDK. Should be a BASE64 string. It can be a casual BASE64 string, for example, it can be generated by the command `echo anystring|base64`.
  ```

In the container, execute `verify-attestation-service.sh` to verify the attestation service quote.

  ```bash
  bash verify-attestation-service.sh
  ```
  **4. Register your MREnclave to EHSM**

  Register the MREnclave with metadata of your MREnclave (appid, apikey, mr_enclave, mr_signer) obtained in above steps to EHSM through running a python script:

  ```bash
  # At /ppml/trusted-big-data-ml inside the container now
  python register-mrenclave.py --appid <your_appid> \
                              --apikey <your_apikey> \
                              --url https://<kms_ip>:9000 \
                              --mr_enclave <your_mrenclave_hash_value> \
                              --mr_signer <your_mrensigner_hash_value>
  ```
  You will receive a response containing a `policyID` and save it which will be used to attest runtime MREnclave when running distributed kubernetes application.

  **5. Enable Attestation in configuration**

  First, upload `appid`, `apikey` and `policyID` obtained before to kubernetes as secrets:

  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic kms-secret \
                    --from-literal=app_id=YOUR_KMS_APP_ID \
                    --from-literal=api_key=YOUR_KMS_API_KEY \
                    --from-literal=policy_id=YOUR_POLICY_ID
  ```

  Configure `spark-driver-template.yaml` and `spark-executor-template.yaml` to enable Attestation as follows:
  ``` yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: spark-driver
      securityContext:
        privileged: true
      env:
        - name: ATTESTATION
          value: true
        - name: PCCS_URL
          value: https://your_pccs_ip:your_pccs_port
        - name: ATTESTATION_URL
          value: your_attestation_url
        - name: APP_ID
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: kms-secret
              key: app_id
        - name: API_KEY
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: kms-secret
              key: app_key
        - name: ATTESTATION_POLICYID
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: policy-id-secret
              key: policy_id
  ...
  ```
  You should get `Attestation Success!` in logs after you submit a PPML job if the quote generated with `user_report` is verified successfully by Attestation Service. Or you will get `Attestation Fail! Application killed!` or `JASONObject["result"] is not a JASONObject`and the job will be stopped.

#### Step 3. Encrypt Data
Encrypt the input data of your Big Data & AI applications (here we use SimpleQuery) and then upload encrypted data to the nfs server (or any file system such as HDFS that can be accessed by the cluster).

1. Generate the input data `people.csv` for SimpleQuery application
  you can use [generate_people_csv.py](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/blob/main/ppml/scripts/generate_people_csv.py). The usage command of the script is `python generate_people.py </save/path/of/people.csv> <num_lines>`. The save path should be reachable by `people.csv`, like a shared docker-mount-path.

2. Generate a primary key.
    ```
    docker exec -i bigdl-ppml-client-k8s bash
    cd /ppml/bigdl-ppml/src/bigdl/ppml/kms/ehsm/
    export APIKEY=your_apikey
    export APPID=your_appid
    python client.py -api generate_primary_key -ip ehsm_ip -port ehsm_port
    ```

3. Encrypt `people.csv`
    
    As for data encryption/decryption based on crypto, We recommend you to use data key generated from primary key, which are both managed by KMS(Key Management Service) that is not only convenient but also safe. This is contributed by that our KMSs like [EHSM](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/tree/main/ppml/services/ehsm/kubernetes#deploy-bigdl-ehsm-kms-on-kubernetes) have hardware-protected memory and TLS/SSL-encrypted network etc. and no sensitive secret is written to disk.
    In practice, you only need to specify a KMS-pre-generated primary key when submitting job, and PPMLContext backend will automatically generate a data key from the primary one you provide, and manage the two in the whole lifecycle:

#### Step 4. Build Big Data & AI applications
To build your own Big Data & AI applications, refer to [develop your own Big Data & AI applications with BigDL PPML](#4-develop-your-own-big-data--ai-applications-with-bigdl-ppml). The code of SimpleQuery is in [here](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/blob/main/scala/ppml/src/main/scala/com/intel/analytics/bigdl/ppml/examples/SimpleQuerySparkExample.scala), it is already built into bigdl-ppml-spark_${SPARK_VERSION}-${BIGDL_VERSION}.jar, and the jar is put into PPML image.

#### Step 5. Submit Job to Query
When the Big Data & AI application and its input data is prepared, you are ready to submit BigDL PPML jobs.

You need to choose the deploy mode and the way to submit the job first.

* **There are 4 modes to submit a job**:

    1. **local mode**: run jobs locally without connecting to the cluster. It is exactly the same as using spark-submit to run your application: `$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class "SimpleApp" --master local[4] target.jar`, driver and executors are not protected by SGX.

        </p>


    2. **local SGX mode**: run jobs locally with SGX guarded. As the picture shows, the client JVM is running in a SGX Enclave so that driver and executors can be protected.
        <p align="left">
          <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61072813/174703165-2afc280d-6a3d-431d-9856-dd5b3659214a.png" width='250px' />
        </p>


    3. **client SGX mode**: run jobs in k8s client mode with SGX guarded. As we know, in K8s client mode, the driver is deployed locally as an external client to the cluster. With **client SGX mode**, the executors running in K8S cluster are protected by SGX, and the driver running in the client is also protected by SGX.
        <p align="left">

        </p>


    4. **cluster SGX mode**: run jobs in k8s cluster mode with SGX guarded. As we know, in K8s cluster mode, the driver is deployed on the k8s worker nodes like executors. With **cluster SGX mode**, the driver and executors running in K8S cluster are protected by SGX.
        <p align="left">

        </p>


* **There are two options to submit PPML jobs**:
    * use [PPML CLI](./docs/submit_job.md#ppml-cli) to submit jobs manually
    * use [helm chart](./docs/submit_job.md#helm-chart) to submit jobs automatically

Here we use **k8s client mode** and **PPML CLI** to run. Check other modes, please see [PPML CLI Usage Examples](./docs/submit_job.md#usage-examples). Alternatively, you can also use Helm to submit jobs automatically, see the details in [Helm Chart Usage](./docs/submit_job.md#helm-chart).

      ```


  3. check runtime status: exit the container or open a new terminal

      To check the logs of the Spark driver, run
      ```
      sudo kubectl logs $( sudo kubectl get pod | grep "simplequery.*-driver" -m 1 | cut -d " " -f1 )
      ```
      To check the logs of a Spark executor, run
      ```
      sudo kubectl logs $( sudo kubectl get pod | grep "simplequery-.*-exec" -m 1 | cut -d " " -f1 )
      ```

  4. If you setup [PPML Monitoring](docs/prepare_environment.md#optional-k8s-monitioring-setup), you can check PPML Dashboard to monitor the status in http://kubernetes_master_url:3000

#### Step 6. Monitor Job by History Server
You can monitor spark events using the history server. The history server provides an interface to watch and log spark performance and metrics.
​     
First, create a shared directory that can be accessed by both the client and the other worker containers in your cluster. For example, you can create an empty directory under the mounted nfs path or hdfs. The spark drivers and executors will write their event logs to this destination, and the history server will read logs here as well.
​     
Second, enter your client container and edit `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf`, where the history server reads the configurations:
```
spark.eventLog.enabled           true
spark.eventLog.dir               <your_shared_dir_path> ---> e.g. file://<your_nfs_dir_path> or hdfs://<your_hdfs_dir_path>
spark.history.fs.logDirectory    <your_shared_dir_path> ---> similar to spark.eventLog.dir
```

Third, run the below command and the history server will start to watch automatically:
```
$SPARK_HOME/sbin/start-history-server.sh
```

Next, when you run spark jobs, enable writing driver and executor event logs in java/spark-submit commands by setting spark conf like below:
```
...
--conf spark.eventLog.enabled=true \
--conf spark.eventLog.dir=<your_shared_dir_path> \
...
```

Starting spark jobs, you can find event log files at `<your_shared_dir_path>` like:
```
$ ls
local-1666143241860 spark-application-1666144573580
     
$ cat spark-application-1666144573580
......
{"Event":"SparkListenerJobEnd","Job ID":0,"Completion Time":1666144848006,"Job Result":{"Result":"JobSucceeded"}}
{"Event":"SparkListenerApplicationEnd","Timestamp":1666144848021}
```

You can use these logs to analyze spark jobs. Moreover, you are also allowed to surf from a web UI provided by the history server by accessing `http://localhost:18080`:
![history server UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60865256/196840282-6584f36e-5e72-4144-921e-4536d3391f05.png)    


#### Step 7. Decrypt and Read Result
When the job is done, you can decrypt and read the result of the job. More details in [Decrypt Job Result](./services/kms-utils/docker/README.md#3-enroll-generate-key-encrypt-and-decrypt).

  ```
  docker exec -i $KMSUTIL_CONTAINER_NAME bash -c "bash /home/entrypoint.sh decrypt $appid $apikey $input_path"
  ```

### 3.3 More BigDL PPML Examples
In addition to the above Spark Pi and Python HelloWorld programs running locally, and simplequery application running on the k8s cluster, we also provide other examples including Trusted Data Analysis, Trusted ML, Trusted DL and Trusted FL. You can find these examples in [more examples](./docs/examples.md). 

## 4. Develop your own Big Data & AI applications with BigDL PPML

First, you need to create a `PPMLContext`, which wraps `SparkSession` and provides methods to read encrypted data files into plain-text RDD/DataFrame and write DataFrame to encrypted data files. Then you can read & write data through `PPMLContext`.

If you are familiar with Spark, you may find that the usage of `PPMLConext` is very similar to Spark. **The explanations of PPMLContext configurations in the following can be found [here](#configurations-of-key-and-kms-in-ppmlcontext)**.

### 4.1 Create PPMLContext

- create a PPMLContext with `appName`

   This is the simplest way to create a `PPMLContext`. When you don't need to read/write encrypted files, you can use this way to create a `PPMLContext`.

   <details open>
    <summary>scala</summary>

   ```scala
   import com.intel.analytics.bigdl.ppml.PPMLContext

   val sc = PPMLContext.initPPMLContext("MyApp")
   ```

   </details>

  <details>
    <summary>python</summary>

   ```python
   from bigdl.ppml.ppml_context import *
   
   sc = PPMLContext("MyApp")
   ```

   </details>

   If you want to read/write encrypted files, then you need to provide more information.

- create a PPMLContext with `appName` & `ppmlArgs`

   `ppmlArgs` is ppml arguments in a Map, `ppmlArgs` varies according to the kind of Key Management Service (KMS) you are using. Key Management Service (KMS) is used to generate `primaryKey` and `dataKey` to encrypt/decrypt data. We provide 3 types of KMS ——SimpleKeyManagementService, EHSMKeyManagementService, and AzureKeyManagementService.

   Refer to [KMS Utils](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/blob/main/ppml/services/kms-utils/docker/README.md) to use KMS to generate `primaryKey` and `dataKey`, then you are ready to create **PPMLContext** with `ppmlArgs`.

  - For `SimpleKeyManagementService`:

### 4.2 Read and Write Files

To read/write data, you should set the `CryptoMode`:

- `plain_text`: no encryption
- `AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding`: for CSV, JSON and text file
- `AES_GCM_V1`: for PARQUET only
- `AES_GCM_CTR_V1`: for PARQUET only

To write data, you should set the `write` mode:

- `overwrite`: Overwrite existing data with the content of dataframe.
- `append`: Append the content of the dataframe to existing data or table.
- `ignore`: Ignore the current write operation if data/table already exists without any error.
- `error`: Throw an exception if data or table already exists.
- `errorifexists`: Throw an exception if data or table already exists.

### 4.3 Create Multi-Party PPMLContext

As for multi-party computation scenarios where multiple data sources, KMSs and keys exist, you can also use the `initPPMLContext` method to automatically initialize PPML Context with support for multiple key management services and data sources.   

You just need to specify the configurations of one or more primary keys as below:

#### **Configurations of key and KMS in PPMLContext**

1. ***Primary key*** is applied to encrypt and decrypt data key, and one primary key can be bound to multiple data keys. In PPMLContext, a primary key can be provided in two ways, a plaintext base64 string or a key generated by KMS:

- **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.plainText:**  a plaintext base64 key string, which PPMLContext will use to encrypt the data key directly, and this is only for demo purposes and not recommended in production in consideration of security.

- **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.kms.type:**  type of an existing KMS instance, e.g. `SimpleKeyManagementService`, `EHSMKeyManagementService`, `AzureKeyManagementService` or `BigDLKeyManagementService`. PPMLContext will retrieve a pre-generated primary key that is managed by the KMS.

  The `[PrimaryKeyName]` field above can be any string, and in a multi-party computation scenario, you can configure multiple primary keys with different names for different parties. (**Note:** since [Trusted SimpleQuery With Multiple Data source/KMS](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/blob/main/ppml/docs/examples.md#run-trusted-simplequery) is an implementation example of business logic, primary-key names in it cannot be specified freely and must be `AmyPK` and `BobPK`.)

2. Type-specific parameters for each ***KMS*** instance:

- For `SimpleKeyManagementService`:

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.material:**  the encrypted primary key path of SimpleKMS.

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.kms.appId:**  APPID of SimpleKMS.

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.kms.apiKey:**  APIKEY of SimpleKMS.

- For `EHSMKeyManagementService`:

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.material:**  the encrypted primary key path of EHSM.

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.kms.ip:**  EHSM service IP.

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.kms.port:**  EHSM port number.

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.kms.appId:**  EHSM APPID.

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.kms.apiKey:**  EHSM APIKEY.

- For `AzureKeyManagementService`:

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.material:**  the encrypted primary key path of Azure KMS.

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.kms.vault:** Azure KMS KeyVault.

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.kms.clientId:** Azure KMS clientId.

- For `BigDLKeyManagementService`:

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.material:**  primary key name of BigDL KMS.

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.kms.ip:**  BigDL KMS service IP.

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.kms.port:**  BigDL KMS port number.

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.kms.user:**  BigDL KMS user name.

  **spark.bigdl.primaryKey.*[PrimaryKeyName]*.kms.token:**  BigDL KMS user token.

An implementation can be seen in [Trusted SimpleQuery With Multiple Data source/KMS](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/blob/main/ppml/docs/examples.md#run-trusted-simplequery). You can follow the example to develop your multi-party computation application.
