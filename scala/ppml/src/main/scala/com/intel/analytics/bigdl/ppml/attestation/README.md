# General Attestation Interface

Support Grapmine, Occlum and SGX SDK.

## Environment
You should have an available attestation service to attest with. You can use `EHSMAttestationService` and configure eHSM-KMS according to [this link](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/tree/main/ppml/services/pccs-ehsm/kubernetes), or you can just use `DummyAttestationService` for debug. 
To enable bi-attestation, you also need SGXSDK to do quote verification. [Here](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL-core/tree/master/ppml#requirements) is the guide to install SGXSDK and SGX DCAP verification libs.

## Usage
You can attest your environment with AttestationCLI by command like:
```bash
java -cp [dependent-jars] com.intel.analytics.bigdl.ppml.attestation.AttestationCLI -i <appID> -k <appKey> -u <asURL> -t <asType> -c <challenge> -p <userReport> 
```

## Parameters
`-i` **appID** , `-k` **appKey** The appID and appKey pair generated by your attestation service. It is a gap that BigDL names the key as `appkey` while EHSM refers it as `apikey`. We will also turn to `apikey` in the future.

`-u` **asURL** URL of attestation service. Should match the format `<ip_address>:<port>`, default is `127.0.0.1:9000`

`-t` **asType** Type of attestation service. Currently support `DummyAttestationService` and `EHSMAttestationService`, default is `EHSMAttestationService`.

`-c` **challenge** Challenge to get quote of attestation service which will be verified by local SGXSDK. Used only for bi-attestation. Should be a BASE64 string, default is "" and will skip bi-attestation.

`-p` **userReport** User report to generate quote and attested by attestation service. Default is `test`.
