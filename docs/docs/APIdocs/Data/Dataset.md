`Dataset` is a set of data which is used in the model optimization process. The `dataset` can be accessed in a random data sample sequence. In the training process, the data sequence is a looped endless sequence. While in the validation process, the data sequence is a limited length sequence.  User can use the `data()` method to get the data sequence.
