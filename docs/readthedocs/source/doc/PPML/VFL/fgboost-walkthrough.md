# FGBoost Walkthrough
**Note:** We recommend to go through [VFL Key Concepts]() before this walkthrough.

FGBoost supports gradient boosted tree algorithm in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL).


## Key Concepts
A **tree** is a decision tree (DT) with a set of nodes, each node represents a split in DT.

An **algorithm instance** is an instance to run FGBoost algorithm, each instance holds a list of DT for running boosted tree. The algorithm supports `FGBoostRegression` for regression task and `FGBoostClassification` for classification task.


## Quick Start
We provide some quick start project of FGBoost, see following
