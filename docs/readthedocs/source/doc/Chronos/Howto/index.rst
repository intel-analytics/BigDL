Forecasting
-------------------------
* `Train forcaster on single node <how_to_train_forecaster_on_one_node.html>`__

    In this guidance, **we demonstrate how to train forecasters on one node**. In the training process, forecaster will learn the pattern (like the period, scale...) in history data. Although Chronos supports training on a cluster, it's highly recommeneded to try one node first before allocating a cluster to make life easier.
