# Use Chronos benchmark tool
This page demonstrates how to use Chronos benchmark tool to benchmark forecasting performance on platforms.

## Basic Usage
The benchmark tool is installed automatically when Chronos is installed using conda. To get preliminary knowledge of forecasting performance on platform, run benchmark tool with default options using following command:
```bash
benchmark-chronos -l 96 -o 720
```
```eval_rst
.. note::
    **Required Options**:

     `-l/--lookback` and `-o/--horizon` are required options for Chronos benchmark tool. Use `-l/--lookback <int>` to specify the history time steps while use `-o/--horizon <int>` to specify the output time steps.
```
By default, the tool will load `tsinghua_electricity` dataset and train a `TCNForecaster` with input lookback and horizon parameters under `pytroch` framework. As it loads, it prints information about hardware, Nano environment variables and benchmark parameters. When benchmarking is completed, it reports the average throughput during training process. Users may be able to improve forecasting performance by following suggested changes on Nano environment variables.

Besides the default usage, more execution parameters can be set to obtain more benchmark results. Read on to learn more about the configuration options available in Chronos benchmark tool.

## Configuration Options
The benchmark tool provides various options for configuring execution parameters. Some key configuration options are introduced in this part and a list of all options is given in [**Advanced Options**](#Advanced Options).

### Model
The tool provides several built-in time series forecasting models, including TCN, LSTM, Seq2Seq, NBeats and Autoformer. To specify which model to use, run benchmark tool with `-m/--model`. If not specified, TCN is used as the default.
```bash
benchmark-chronos -m lstm -l 96 -o 720
```

### Stage
Regarding a model, training and inference stages are most concerned. By setting `-s/--stage` parameter, users can obtain knowledge of throughput during training (`-s train`), throughput during inference (`-s throughput`) and latency of inference (`-s latency`). If not specified, train is used as the default.
```bash
benchmark-chronos -s latency -l 96 -o 720
``` 

### Dataset
Several built-in datasets can be chosen, including nyc_taxi and tsinghua_electricity. If users are with poor Internet connection and hard to download dataset, run benchmark tool with `-d synthetic_dataset` to use synthetic dataset. Default to be tsinghua_electricity if `-d/--dataset` parameter is not specified.
```bash
benchmark-chronos -d nyc_taxi -l 96 -o 720
```  

### Framework
Pytorch and tensorflow are both supported and can be specified by setting `-f torch` or `-f tensorflow`. But Autoformer does not support tensorflow backend now. The default framework is pytorch.
```bash
benchmark-chronos -f tensorflow -l 96 -o 720
```

### Core number
By default, the benchmark tool will run on all physical cores. And users can explicitly specify the number of cores through `-c/--cores` parameter.
```bash
benchmark-chronos -c 4 -l 96 -o 720
```

### Lookback
Forecasting aims at predicting the future by using the knowledge from the history. The required option `-l/--lookback`corresponds to the length of historical data along time.
```bash
benchmark-chronos -l 96 -o 720
```

### Horizon
Forecasting aims at predicting the future by using the knowledge from the history. The required option `-o/--horizon`corresponds to the length of predicted data along time.
```bash
benchmark-chronos -l 96 -o 720
```

## Advanced Options
Besides, number of processes and epoches can be set by `--training_processes` and `--training_epochs`. Users can also tune batchsize during training and inference through `--training_batchsize` and `--inference_batchsize` respectively.
```bash
benchmark-chronos --training_processes 2 --training_epochs 3 --training_batchsize 32 --inference_batchsize 128 -l 96 -o 720
```

In order to benchmark the performance with accelerator, run the benchmark tool with `--ipex` enabled, then use intel-extension-for-pytorch as accelerator for trainer. If want to use quantized model to predict, just run the benchmark tool with `--quantize` enabled and the quantize framework can be specified by setting `--quantize_type`. Pytorch_fx, pytorch_ipex, onnxrt_qlinearops and openvino are supported currently while default quantize framework is pytorch_fx.
```bash
benchmark-chronos --ipex --quantize --quantize_type pytorch_ipex -l 96 -o 720
```

To speed up inference, accelerators like ONNXRuntime and OpenVINO are usually used. To benchmark inference performance with or without accelerator, run tool with `--inference_framework` to specify without accelerator (`--inference_framework torch`)or with ONNXRuntime (`--inference_framework onnx`) or with OpenVINO (`--inference_framework openvino`).
```bash
benchmark-chronos --inference_framework onnx -l 96 -o 720
```

Moreover, if want to benchmark inference performance of a trained model, run benchmark tool with `--ckpt` to specify the checkpoint path of model. By default, the model for inference will be trained first according to input parameters.

Running the benchmark tool with `-h/--help` yields the following usage message, which contains all configuration options:
```bash
benchmark-chronos -h
```
