# DLlib User Guide

DLlib is a distributed deep learning library for Apache Spark; with DLlib, users can write their deep learning applications as standard Spark programs (using either Scala or Python APIs), which can directly run on top of existing Hadoop, Spark or K8s clusters. It includes the fcuntionalities of the original [BigDL](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/tree/branch-0.14) project, and is highly recommended to use the high-level APIs provided by DLLib, including:

* [Keras-like API](keras-api.md) 
* [Spark ML pipeline support](nnframes.md)
