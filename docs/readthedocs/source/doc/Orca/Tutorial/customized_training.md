# How to Customize Your Pytorch Training Process

This tutorial provides a overall guide on how to customize your own pytorch training process with callbacks mechanism.


## Callback Mechanism Introduction

### What is callback mechanism?

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

### How does a callback work?

Callbacks mechanism divides the entire training process into several points according to different stages, so users can implement various processes of training by overriding these callbacks of corresponding points.

### How many callbacks are there?

And there are two kinds of callbacks here:

One is the callback that does nothing by default like `on_run_end`. We may utilize our existing Callback class to achieve this.
```python
class Callback:
    
    def on_run_begin(self, runner): ...
    def on_run_end(self, runner): ...
    def on_epoch_begin(self, runner): ...
    def on_epoch_end(self, runner): ...
    def on_iter_begin(self, runner): ...
    def on_iter_end(self, runner): ...
```

Another is the callback that contains default behaviors defined by orca: on_iter_forward, on_iter_backward and on_lr_adjust. These methods are somewhat special, because only one special MainCallback should be allowed to implement these methods among all callbacks(otherwise there will propagate forward and backward twice).
```python
class MainCallback(Callback);

    def on_iter_forward(self, runner):
        inputs, targets = runner.batch
        runner.outputs = runner.model(inputs)
        inputs, targets = runner.batch
        runner.loss = runner.criterion(runner.outputs, targets)

    def on_iter_backward(self, runner):
        runner.optimizer.zero_grad()
        runner.loss.backward()
        runner.optimizer.step()
    
    def on_lr_adjust(self, runner):
        if runner.lr_scheduler is not None:
           runner.lr_scheduler.step()

    def on_train_forward(self, runner): # By default it will call on_iter_forward.
        self.on_iter_forward(runner)

    def on_val_forward(self, runner): # By default it will call on_iter_forward.
        self.on_iter_forward(runner)
```

In general, there are 24 points where callbacks can be inserted from the beginning to the end of model training:

* global points: `before_run`, `after_run`, `before_epoch`, `after_epoch`, `before_iter`, `after_iter`, *`on_iter_forward`
* training points: `before_train_epoch`, `after_train_epoch`,  `before_train_iter`, `before_val_iter`, *`on_train_forward`, *`on_iter_backward`, *`on_lr_adjust`
* validation points: `before_val_epoch`, `after_val_epoch`, `before_val_iter`, `after_val_iter`, *`on_val_forward`
* prediction points: `before_pred_epoch`, `after_pred_epoch`, `before_pred_iter`, `after_pred_iter`, `on_pred_forward`

Note that points marked with star are only available in `MainCallBack`.

### How are these callbacks composed?

Basically we assume the **training** process as the following pseudocode:
```python

# In TorchRunner.train_epochs:

...

call_hooks("on_run_begin", self)

for epoch in range(epochs):

    self.epoch+=1
    call_hooks("on_epoch_begin", self)

    for batch_idx, batch in enumerate(self.dataloader):
        self.batch = batch
        self.batch_idx = batch_idx
        call_hooks("on_iter_begin", self)

        call_hooks("on_iter_forward", self)

        call_hooks("on_iter_backward", self)  # this will be called when training

        call_hooks("on_iter_end", self)

        # We should not present items in last iteration to users in the next iteration.
        if hasattrs(self, 'batch'|'batch_idx'|'outputs'|'loss')
           del self.batch
           del self.batch_idx
           del self.outputs
           del self.loss

    call_hooks("on_lr_adjust", self)  # this will be called when training

    call_hooks("on_epoch_end", self)

call_hooks("on_run_end", self)

```

### What attributes user can access during the whole process?

There are attributes that you can access **all the time** and others that can only be accessed **in some stages**:

Globally Access:
* num_epochs: Int. Total epochs to be trained.
* epochs: Int. Current epoch number.
* train_loader: Torch dataloader. The train dataloader returned by train_dataloader_creator.
* val_loader: Torch dataloader. The validation dataloader returned by val_dataloader_creator.
* rank: Int. The rank of this runner.
* model: Torch module. The model returned by model_creator.
* optimizer: Torch optimaizer. The optimizer returned by optimizer_creator.
* scheduler: Torch scheduler. The scheduler returned by scheduler_creator.
* criterion: The loss function returned by loss_creator.
* stop: Boolean. Whether to stop training in this iteration.
* global_step: Int. The total number of iterations.

Can be accessed within iterations(like `before_train_iter`, `after_train_iter` etc.):
* batch: The data batch of this iteration.
* batch_idx: The batch index of this iteration.
* output: The output of the model in this iteration.
* loss: The loss calculated in this iteration.


## Callback Usage Examples

You only need to pass callbacks to `est.fit`, `est.evaluate` and `est.predict` as parameters to let the runner do the work.
```python
est = Estimator.from_torch(...)

# Will automatically detect whether there is a unique mainHook, and put it in the first place in runner._hook if so.
est.fit(...,
        callbacks=[CustomMainCB(), Hook_1(), Hook_2(), ...])

# if you don't need to modify training process

est.evaluate(...,
        callbacks=[hook_1, hook_2, ...])

```

### Usage 1
Some popular image models like Mask-RCNN for object detection calculate the loss in a slightly different way that they calculate the loss inside the model.
```python
loss_dict = model(images, targets)
losses = sum(loss for loss in loss_dict.values())
```

We can implement the following logic in MainCallback to meet this requirement:
```python
class CustomMainCB(MainCallBack):
    def on_iter_forward(self, runner):
        # Forward features
        image, target = runner.batch
        runner.output= runner.model(image, target)
        # Compute loss
        runner.loss = sum(loss for loss in runner.output.values())
```

Note that you must assign attributes `output` and `loss` back in `on_iter_forward`.

### Usage 2
In some cases user manually adjusts the learning rate without the help of the scheduler like:
```python
def adjust_learning_rate(optimizer, gamma, epoch, step_index, iteration, epoch_size):
    """Sets the learning rate
    # Adapted from PyTorch Imagenet example:
    # https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/imagenet/main.py
    """
    warmup_epoch = -1
    if epoch <= warmup_epoch:
        lr = 1e-6 + (initial_lr-1e-6) * iteration / (epoch_size * warmup_epoch)
    else:
        lr = initial_lr * (gamma ** (step_index))
    for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:
        param_group['lr'] = lr
    return lr
```

We can implement the following logic in MainCallback to meet this requirement:
```python
class CustomMainCB(MainCallBack):
    def on_lr_adjust(self, runner):
        warmup_epoch = 5
        if runner.epochs <= warmup_epoch:
            lr = 1e-6 + (initial_lr-1e-6) * runner.batch_idx / (epoch_size * warmup_epoch)
        else:
            lr = initial_lr * (gamma ** (step_index))
        for param_group in runner.optimizer.param_groups:
            param_group['lr'] = lr
        return lr
```

### Usage 3
If you want to save the currently trained model at the end of each epoch automatically, you may just implement this in `after_train_epoch`:
```python
class ModelCheckpoint(Callback):
    
    ...
    
    def after_train_epoch(self, runner):
        """
        Called at the end of an epoch.
        Subclasses should override for any actions to run. This function should only
        be called during TRAIN mode.
        :param epoch:  Integer, index of epoch.
        """
        stats = {"epoch": runner.epochs}
        last_ckpt_path = self._format_checkpoint_name(dirname=self.dirname,
                                                      filename=self.filename,
                                                      stats=stats)
        runner.save_checkpoint(last_ckpt_path, self.save_weights_only)
```

Actually you can just pass `ModelCheckpoint` callback in `bigdl.orca.learn.pytorch.callbacks.model_checkpoint` to estimator.fit() to achieve this.
