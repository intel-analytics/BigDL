# BigDL-LLM Transformers INT4 Optimization for HuggingFace Transformers Agent
In this folder, we apply low-bit optimizations to [HuggingFace Transformers Agents](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/transformers_agents) using BigDL-LLM, which allows LLMs to use tools such as image generation, image captioning, audio transcription, text summarization, etc.

- [Image-Captioning](Image-Captioning): An example of running Hugging Face Transformers Agent to generate the caption for an image using INT4 optimizations.
- [Audio-Transcription](Audio-Transcription): An example of running Hugging Face Transformers Agent to generate text transcription for an autio using INT4 optimizations.
