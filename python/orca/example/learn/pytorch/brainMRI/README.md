# PyTorch BrainMRI example
We demonstrate how to easily run synchronous distributed PyTorch training using PyTorch Estimator of Project Orca in Analytics Zoo. We use a simple Unet model to train on BrainMRI Segmentation dataset, which is a dataset for image segmentation. See [here](https://www.kaggle.com/s0mnaths/brain-mri-unet-pytorch/notebook) for the original single-node version. A lot of thanks to S0MNATHS, the orginal author of the code. This is the original training code.
